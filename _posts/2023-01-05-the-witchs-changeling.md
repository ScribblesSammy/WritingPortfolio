The bargain had been struck. A child for a better life.

A woman approached the forest, holding a basket away from her at an odd angle. Every few paces, she cast a glance over her shoulder towards the village behind her.

The trees swayed in the wind, whispers passing between branches as they gazed down imperiously. No noise crept from the forest to this edge. All life hushed as the witch emerged suddenly, shadow condensing into fabric and flesh.

Once the woman spotted the figure, she halted momentarily, pausing to stiffen the spine before continuing. Her eyes flickered over the figure- the shadow of a cape swishing in the wind; twitching, reaching hands ending with the glint of moonlight on talons; the feral gaze fixed upon the basket. Uneasy beneath the witch’s eyes, the woman held the basket a little further from her, flinching when it began to emit a shallow cry. She hurried on towards the forest edge.

Upon arriving, she placed the basket on the ground. And withdrew from it her son.

The young woman cared naught for the babe, but shuddered when handing him to the witch. She clutched the talisman at her throat as the infant was inspected, shuddering not at the child’s cries, but at the witch’s arctic gaze.

“The father?”

“He cares nothing for it.” A deep breath, then a recitation of the harsh words that followed the confession of her pregnancy. “The bastard son of a slovenly harlot will never bear his name.”

“And you recall the terms of our agreement?”

Another deep inhale.

“I rescind all rights to the child and it-… his future. In exchange, I receive two enchantments. One to erase the pregnancy, the other to regain the father and secure my future.”

“Very well. The first is already spread. The second is here. Take it and leave. And never forget- any attempt to reveal this bargain, or retrieve the child, will be one you regret.”

The woman nodded, trembling hand reaching for the flask as though it were a snake, then snatching it and fleeing towards the light of the village.

Watching her haste to escape, the witch’s face hardened, seeing not one glance back at the boy in her arms. As if recognising his mother’s departure, the boy began to wail, cries piercing the forest. The witch drew him closer, and as she did, she straightened, and changed. Shadow fell from her face, talons retracted, the icy sheen melted upon meeting the inquisitive grey of the infant. A tubby hand reached out to grasp an ebony curl that slipped from the hood’s cover, a glazed look of wonder falling over his face as he wrapped it around his wrist, grip tightening when she sought to reclaim the strand. His face scrunched up. Eyes screwballed tight. The witch blew gently on his face, which softened into sleep, fist falling lax before being hidden in the blanket. A wave of the hand had the basket trailing behind them as the witch turned and vanished into the black of the trees.

.

When they emerged from the darkness, it was from a rainforest surrounding a lake beside a rondavel. Another woman stood by the lake lighting candles, flame flickering between her fingers. The witch snuck towards her, silent steps drawing her closer, until she stood directly behind her. She placed the boy in the basket, drew forth her claws, and grabbed the other woman’s shoulders, screeching into her ear,

“I have you now, my pretty!”

The second woman screamed and spun, hands raised. Then she stopped and sighed as the witch bent double in laughter.

“Dammit Sekai, how many times do I have to tell you? Scaring me is not funny. It is, however, childish and immature. You are an ancient and powerful being of darkness- this is, frankly, beneath you.”

The witch, Sekai, continued to chuckle as she drew her companion into her arms, whispering apologies into her ear, twirling strands of black around her fingers as she drew back. The other moved away, eyes focused instead on the basket hovering a few feet away.

“Is this him? The boy?” Her eyes flickered to the witch and then back to makeshift cradle swaying before her.

“Yes, Darya, that’s him. Do you think it’ll work? Ought we summon them?”

“We can try. He’s the third this moon, though. Will they even appear?”

“If they think he might be the one, they will.”

The three went inside the round hut, pausing inside the threshold before the door closed with a click. A purple flame twisted in the grate, snarling teeth gnashing at Kai’s approach, a howl puncturing the quiet before it was cut off by a kettle being forced into the void at the centre. Darya pulled off Sekai’s coat, revealing the gleam of bare limbs with ripples twisting below the skin, a wreath of shadow weaving itself into untamed coils of hair, drawing it back off her face, which softened as she turned towards the boy and Darya. Hands reached over to cup her face, like darkness surrounding the moon, before moving once again towards the boy in the basket.

“Set up the candles, my pretty. They are growing impatient. We cannot keep disappointing them.”

.

Night had fallen. Sekai strode in a circle, flames trailing where she stepped, brandishing a broom in one hand, the grain indenting her palm. The baby slept in a ring of rowan, cradled…unaware. Sekai’s familiar, Fatou, sat at Darya’s feet, grooming her tail and occasionally flinging leaf litter at the fire as her witch began to chant, tossing objects into the ring as she retraced her steps. Darya stood, soundless; eyes fixed on the centre of the flames in anticipation. With every pause, her fist clenched a little tighter, flinching into the empty air. At last, silence echoed in the clearing.

After several minutes, Darya’s fist began to loosen, nails withdrawing from flesh and allowing blood to swell in the scratches.

A clap boomed across the lake, rippling it into a tide, and wrenching leaves off trees. This eruption of sound ricocheted back, drawing with it the detritus it had dislodged; this merged together, forming the silhouette of a man. The remnants of the sound crumbled into ash, disintegrating upon contact with the ground, leaving in its place what once had been a man.

The once-man stood upright, at average height, of average build, yet towered into the stars. Sekai looked at him, eyes flicking from head to toe, concealing the urge to recoil from his-its- inexplicable otherness. He stood, in the centre of the circle, flickering between Sekai and the basket.

“Is this the one? Your offering?” His voice was in no way unusual, yet rumbled across the clearing and echoing in their ears, shaking Darya slightly and causing Fatou to shriek.

“It is. A newborn, as you requested. Entirely untainted by humanity.” Sekai stood strong, meeting his gaze, ignoring the little voice that whispered threats and taunts when she did so.

“Bring it to me. I must inspect if it is suitable.” Emotion flickered behind Sekai’s eyes before the chill of her gaze resurged.

“That is not our arrangement. Do not try to break faith- many before you have tried and failed. Bring your partner here, swear before the night sky to obey the laws of hospitality, and you may see the boy. Otherwise, you should depart. I do not waste time on those who would waste mine.”

The once-man tilted his head, darkness swelling from his pupil like ink in water, the stench of ocean rising and mingling with that of petrichor and tropical mosses. His form lost focus, flickering in and out of sight, before the tidal scent retreated, and another man appeared in the circle. But he wasn’t quite a man either. His fingers stretched into tentacles that dripped ink, mingling with the water that gushed off him. Sekai clenched her fist tighter, broom branding the base of her thumb as she extended it into the circle, arm wavering as she did so. Tentacles wrapped themselves around the other end as the two not-quite-men gripped the broom and stepped out of the circle, their otherness crumbling to ash as they stepped through the flames, until all that stood were two men holding hands and leaning over to look towards the baby in the basket.

“Are you sure this is him, witch? You have disappointed us before.” The newcomer’s irises expanded and shrank as he spoke, like the tide encapsulated in an orb.

“I’m never sure, Crakcry. But I still try. Come meet the boy.” Sekai turned from them, as Darya let out a long-held breath, reaching down to allow Fatou to climb onto her shoulder and pick through her hair. Crakcry halted before her, looking up and down.

“It is rare to see another creature of the sea this far from its reach. Where is your skin, selkie? Why do you not swim with your sisters?”

“Leave her, Crakcry. My companion is to be left alone- she is not a toy for your amusement. The boy is the reason you came, so do not dally and test my long-suffering patience. Bring Forved with you- unsupervised warlocks are not permitted in my territory,” came Sekai’s cutting reproach from by the cradle, her shadow tugging at their own to pull them along.

The four adults stood around the boy, the men looking at him, the women looking at the men, all eyes flitting over the subject of their gaze in search of something. At last, Forved reached down towards the boy, hissing when his hand touched the rowan, before Darya collected the child and handed him to Crakcry, the other man cradling his singed appendage. Two faces relaxed when the boy’s eyes opened as his mouth stretched into a yawn before he peered at the two. When a tiny hand reached up, Forved lifted a finger towards it, mouth melting into a slightly-too-wide grin as it was enclosed in the baby’s fist. The baby shifted in Crakcry’s grip, almost falling. Everyone lunged. Hands surged towards him. But Crakcry recovered from the wiggle, regaining his grip. Bouncing the boy on his hip, his kærasti reclaiming the boy’s hand. The boy began to spit up as he giggled, other arm flailing wildly in his glee.

“His parents?” Forved inquired, his echo quieted to a captivated hush, eyes remaining fixed on the tiny fist clenching his finger.

“Gave up all rights. If you adopt him, he will be entirely yours.” Sekai’s voice quavered but did not break as she addressed the obliviously attentive couple. “Is he the one?”

The two men exchanged glances between them, gaze flickering between themselves, the baby, and the witch’s company. A hush fell over the group, humidity and silence engulfing the scene as a wordless debate seized the minute.

“I believe so.” Forven’s shoulders, which had tensed at the question, released subtly at his demon’s words. “We will depart then. Your reputation for helping those in our community is well-founded, witch. I hear there is yet to be a… mystically-inclined client whom you have been unable to help. Is it true, what I’ve heard about you arranging a surrogacy agreement for some Seelie prince?”

“I do not discuss my client base- something I often assured you of. Do not pry. I will visit next moon to see how everything is going. You have all the supplies, you told me?”

Crakcry’s voice was soft as he stroked the head nestled into his chest.

“We acquired them before we solicited your services. We had tried finding a child before- few are willing to hand a babe to a warlock, even fewer to a demon. How ever do you manage it?”

Sekai’s lips twisted into a mockery of a grin.

“I simply make an offer they cannot refuse.”
