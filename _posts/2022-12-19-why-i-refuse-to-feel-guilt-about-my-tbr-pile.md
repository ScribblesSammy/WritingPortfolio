Raise your hand if your 'To Be Read' pile is more sizable than manageable. Given the content I've seen on bookish sides of social media, this is not an area in which I am alone. Many people there discuss in captions how their best efforts have been insufficient in managing the ever-growing stacks. And for readers, the end-of-year is often paired with looming reading goals not quite achieved. I too am gradually working to dig my way out of a mound over a hundred titles. And have stopped feeling guilty for this. Why, you ask? 

Firstly, because I am still reading. I put my hands up and state that I have been known to overbuy at the start of a hobby, drop it, and have the materials lying around for months. This does elicit a certain level of shame over the wastefulness involved in materials, money and space. But this is not the case in reading. I read every day- even if it isn't a new book or a physical book. (Though a book can be re-read many times even when the next new read has been selected.) I will read those books eventually. Other books just have my attention more right now. Even as I continue to accrue more books on my shelf and e-reader.

Second, because I do not own more than I can store. Is space tight on my bookshelf? Yes, absolutely. I recently rearranged it to fit more better after buying a few more than intended. Do I own more than I probably should, in light of the TBR? Yes again. Especially when I consider the amount owned digitally and therefore don't have to look at when considering how many are on that bookcase. Despite this, I am not infringing on others space. 

Thirdly, supporting the book industry is important. Buying second-hand is excellent. Good prices, older editions, the environmental benefits, and the possibility of scoring a hidden gem. But buying new books is not something I am willing to give up. Partially because much of my reading is done via digital books, and it isn't practical or (in most cases) entirely legal to purchase these second-hand. Partially because new-releases are easier to guarantee availability in shops than in charity shops where they depend on what they are given. And partially because I like pristine spines and no dog-ears, as I read them in such a way as to ensure they remain this way. Buying these books supports booksellers, publishers, authors, printers, and all others involved in the production of these products. As with any business, buying the product supports those creating them.

And finally, because why should I? People collect so many items, from stamps to dolls to coins to records to other, stranger things. Buying books provides pleasure at the moment, entertainment for the duration, a decoration at the conclusion until the entertainment is renewed during a re-read. Having a TBR taller than I am (not very difficult, unfortunately) means more of all of the above, without having to seek out new titles I may be interested in- they are pre-existing and available to go whenever I so choose.

So. Who has felt guilty about the size of their to be read piles? And who else has decided to stop being ashamed about it and instead to luxuriate in having this opportunity and options?
