*Cinderella Is Dead* by Kalynn Bayron is a sapphic reimagining of the classic story- a dystopian hellscape hiding in the wings of fairytale romance. It was far from my first fairy tale reimagining, nor even my first women-loving-women (wlw) Cinderella, but it was still enjoyable. It didn't draw me in as many stories do, but the choices in the storytelling that frustrated me make sense to the plot.

**The Relationships**

Speaking as a reader, rather than a dating expert, the social connections in this book were incredibly frustrating. Homophobia infiltrates every relationship Sophia has, from familial to romantic and everything inbetween. It fits the intensely patriarchal and misogynistic world Bayron constructs, and reflects an unfortunately common experience for non-cishet individuals, so its inclusion made sense. But it was infuriating that the respite from this, the literal abandonment of society and fleeing from everything it represents, took so long to come to fruition. While it added to the sense of security with Constance in the 'safe' space of the wilderness, not having one relationship in her life she could depend upon was not expected or welcome to my reading tastes.

And it took so long for the relationship to progress beyond allies. Erin, the original love interest, was maddening. She had internalised homophobia and weaponised it against the protagonist, creating a hopeless unbalanced relationship. Erin needed to deconstruct this, and Sophia deserved a relationship where she could be upfront about who she is- something Erin wouldn't and/or couldn't do. The relationship with Constance was better, but took so long to reach because of my second problem with it.

**The Plot and Finale**

It dragged. Took ten chapters to get good. The book itself was not long, but because the romances of the book were not especially enthralling (the first because of the borderline-toxicity of it, the second because it was so tentative and unsure of itself) it failed to captivate as others have. The story itself was enjoyable, it just took too long to hook me. It was almost a DNF.

The story was an enchanting read. A young girl escapes the ball facilitating forced marriages after escaping a terrible situation and stumbling across a friend's desiccated corpse. She flees guards and certain death, racing to the woods and meeting Constance, a descendant of Cinderella’s step-sister. The two then commit to the plot of most dystopian YA- bringing down a tyrannical kingdom. A solid premise with a great deal open to it and great opportunity for exploration between author, reader, and character. 

*Cinderella Is Dead*, however, was too close to another fairytale story I had read previously- *Enchanted* by Alethea Kontis, for those interested. Though they were based on very different stories, the plan reached by the girls on how to defeat the king was too close to that of Kontis’ work, especially when the plot twists mirrored one another. Both revolved around the enlistment of an isolated fairy godmother; both reveal it is a trusted fairy fuelling the tyrannical king through the harvesting of women's youth and life force. In all fairness, Bayron’s reveal of that twist surpassed that of Kontis, as did the story’s ability to evoke emotion in the reader. It was simply the similarities in these texts that failed to engulf me as a reader. It felt too similar to a re-read at points, rather than a fresh story.

**Why I Enjoyed It Despite This**

*Cinderella Is Dead* was still a good book. It had a solid premise with a lovable protagonist the reader could truly root for. The second, main love interest had an actual character with their own motivation who did not depend on the protagonist to rescue her or act as only as a conduit for the main character's development. Interactions were not merely an excuse to elevate or disparage Sophia, despite the overwhelming flavour of homophobia invoked by many of them. And had I not read *Enchanted* previously, the twist near the finale would have been a gripping, gasp-worthy revelation. Overall, it was an excellent text, simply not to my particular tastes.

It was also the contrast against *Ash* that made me realise how much better a lesbian Cinderella could be. Having been released a decade earlier, *Ash*’s Cinderella story was more typically fantasy, with a love triangle between protagonist, fairy, and royal huntress. But when it came to the actual courtship or even dynamic between the sapphic characters, Lo fell flat in developing anything stimulating in the relationships. (Granted, at the time of reading my ability to sense romance between characters was limited, but others had similar complaints about the book.) *Cinderella Is Dead* has a character who knows and accepts her sexual identity and is not ashamed to pursue romantic attractions, even in the restrictive society in which she was raised. Ash only truly wove that in in the final chapters of the book, leaving far too much of the book to abusive stepmother and predatory older man.

In a way, it took having read *Enchanted* and *Ash* to truly appreciate the best of *Cinderella Is Dead*, even if it did slightly impede the ability of the book to captivate me as it would have had they been read in a different order.

**Final Thoughts**

3.75 stars. Bayron produced a charming lesbian Cinderella that felt different to previous iterations, even without the sapphic elements, and had an appealing plot that has ensnared many readers and would have captivated me had I read fewer fairy tale stories previously.

Would I recommend it?: Yes.
